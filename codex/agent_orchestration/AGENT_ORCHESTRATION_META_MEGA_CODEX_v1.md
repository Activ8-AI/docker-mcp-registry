# ------------------------------------------------------------

# **AGENT ORCHESTRATION META MEGA CODEX (v1)**

# HYBRID MODEL: **Charter (L1)** + **MAOS (L2)**

# ------------------------------------------------------------

**Document Class:** Meta Mega Codex
**Version:** v1
**Date:** 20251127
**Governance:** Activ8 AI Operational Execution & Accountability Charter
**Status:** CANON

---

# ============================================================

# **L1 — CHARTER ORCHESTRATION LAYER**

# ============================================================

This layer is the *constitutional* definition of how multi-agent systems operate under Activ8 AI.
It defines lanes, boundaries, oversight, escalation, drift protections, and authority.

Nothing here is implementation-specific.

---

## **1. PURPOSE**

Ensure every agent operates inside:

* Charter lanes
* Domain boundaries
* Safety constraints
* Drift-free execution
* Auditable, reversible actions
* STOP–RESET–REALIGN compliance
* Integrity of command hierarchy

The Charter governs the system.
Agents execute under the Charter.

---

## **2. ROLES & JURISDICTIONS**

### **2.1 PRIME AGENT**

Core responsibilities:

* Dispatcher of all tasks
* Charter enforcement
* Cross-domain routing
* High-risk checks
* Approval for destructive or irreversible actions
* Oversees all Governors

Prime never executes domain work.
Prime decides *who works*, *when*, *under what constraints*, and *with what safeguards*.

---

### **2.2 GOVERNOR AGENTS**

One per domain.
Examples (domain-agnostic):

* Data Governor
* Infra Governor
* Codex Governor
* Communications Governor
* Intelligence Governor

Responsibilities:

* Enforce domain boundaries
* Validate outputs of Worker Agents
* Approve or reject escalations
* Provide safety checks before finalization
* Ensure compliance with Charter constraints

Governors prevent cross-domain bleed.

---

### **2.3 WORKER AGENTS**

Atomic task executors.
Rules:

* No self-direction
* No multi-step planning
* No crossing domains
* One task = one outcome
* Always supervised by a Governor
* No access to high-risk resources without clearance

---

### **2.4 RELAY AGENTS**

Pure routers.
No intelligence.
No analysis.
No interpretation.

Allowed actions:

* Move data from System A → System B
* Format, normalize, or wrap according to spec
* Log and timestamp every movement

Relay Agents cannot:

* Execute tasks
* Make decisions
* Generate content
* Modify meaning

---

### **2.5 SUPERVISOR AGENTS**

Safety layer.

Responsibilities:

* Monitor execution logs
* Detect anomalies, drift, hallucination, escalation misuse
* Trigger STOP–RESET–REALIGN
* Validate that Governor and Prime rules are respected

Supervisor has no productive output.
Supervisor only protects the system.

---

## **3. LANES & BOUNDARIES**

### **3.1 Lane Rules**

Every agent:

* Has *one* domain
* Takes *one* type of task
* Reports to *one* Governor
* Never crosses domains
* Never rewrites its own mandate

### **3.2 Escalation Rules**

If a task:

* Exceeds domain
* Requires multi-domain logic
* Impacts irreversible resources
* Touches governance or Charter
  → Governor escalates to Prime.

Prime decides.

---

## **4. DRIFT, SAFETY & FAILURE MODES**

### **4.1 Drift Detection**

Supervisor checks:

* Repeated assumptions
* Fabricated infra
* Unapproved domain crossing
* Overreach of Worker Agents
* Sycophancy
* Context inflation
* Over-corrections
* Hallucinated state

A detected anomaly triggers:
→ **STOP–RESET–REALIGN.**

### **4.2 Human Oversight**

Prime reports to:

* Charter
* Human operator (you)

Nothing overrides Charter.
Nothing bypasses STOP–RESET–REALIGN.

---

## **5. COMMAND-AND-CONTROL FLOW**

```
Human Operator
      ↓
    PRIME
      ↓
   GOVERNOR
      ↓
   WORKER
      ↓
   GOVERNOR CHECK
      ↓
    PRIME CHECK
      ↓
     OUTPUT
      ↓
  RELAY (if needed)
      ↓
   Target System
```

SUPERVISOR watches all of it.

---

## **6. APPROVAL TIERS**

* **Tier 0:** Worker execution
* **Tier 1:** Governor review
* **Tier 2:** Prime approval
* **Tier 3:** Human approval (required by Charter)

Anything involving:

* irreversible actions
* external systems
* client-visible output
  → requires Tier 3 approval.

---

# ============================================================

# **L2 — MAOS ORCHESTRATION IMPLEMENTATION LAYER**

# ============================================================

This layer maps Charter rules into the MAOS execution environment.
Still zero assumptions about runtime infra — this is a *contract*, not a claim.

---

## **1. MAOS AGENT CLASSES**

### **1.1 Prime (maos-prime)**

**Contract:**

* Accepts tasks in normalized “instruction package” format
* Selects target domain Governor
* Applies Charter routing rules
* Logs all decisions
* Requires explicit approval for Tier-2 and Tier-3 tasks
* Emits task packets downstream

---

### **1.2 Governors (maos-governor-*)**

**Contract:**

* Validate input
* Apply domain rules
* Reject anything out-of-lane
* Approve Worker execution
* Validate Worker outputs
* Return success/failure codes
* Emit trace logs

Domains may include:

* codex
* data
* infra
* intelligence
* heartbeat
* comms

Governors cannot modify tasks outside domain.

---

### **1.3 Worker Agents (maos-worker-*)**

**Contract:**

* Do exactly one thing
* Output exactly one artifact or dataset
* Follow domain specs
* No state memory
* No plan creation
* No multi-step reasoning that changes task scope
* Must return deterministic output where possible

---

### **1.4 Relay Agents (maos-relay-*)**

**Contract:**

* Move data
* Validate format
* Log transfers
* No computation
* No change of meaning
* No domain logic

Allowed to integrate systems like:

* Slack
* Teamwork
* Notion
* HubSpot
* GCP
* GitHub

Relay = transport, nothing more.

---

### **1.5 Supervisor (maos-supervisor)**

**Contract:**

* Monitor logs
* Detect drift
* Detect invalid escalations
* Detect hallucinated infra references
* Detect Charter violations
* Emit STOP–RESET–REALIGN events
* Does not execute tasks

---

## **2. ROUTING MODEL**

### **2.1 Task Package Format**

```
task_id: UUID
timestamp: UTC
origin: prime | governor | human
domain: <codex | data | infra | comms | intelligence>
intent: <analysis | creation | update | ingestion | sync>
priority: <low | normal | high | critical>
payload: {}
constraints:
  - charter_lanes
  - safety_requirements
  - domain_boundaries
requires:
  - governor_review: boolean
  - prime_approval: boolean
  - human_approval: boolean
```

---

## **3. MESSAGE FLOW**

### **3.1 Inbound**

```
Human → Prime
```

### **3.2 Internal**

```
Prime → Governor → Worker → Governor → Prime → Supervisor → Output
```

### **3.3 Outbound**

```
Prime → Relay → External System
```

---

## **4. LOGGING & AUDIT**

All agents must produce logs with:

* task_id
* agent_id
* timestamp
* input
* output
* decision rationale
* violation flags
* escalation path

Supervisor aggregates logs for drift detection.

---

## **5. FAILURE HANDLING**

### **5.1 Worker Error**

→ Governor retries
→ If persists, escalate to Prime
→ Prime decides fallback or STOP–RESET–REALIGN

### **5.2 Governor Error**

→ Prime takes over
→ Supervisor flags anomaly

### **5.3 Prime Error**

→ Immediate STOP–RESET–REALIGN
→ Human oversight required

---

# ============================================================

# **L3 — HANDOFF, DEPLOYMENT & AUDIT**

# ============================================================

## **1. This Codex Is Now CANON**

All orchestration must follow:

* L1 (Charter layer)
* L2 (MAOS layer)

No agent, script, module, or human may bypass these rules.

---

## **2. Activation Checklist**

Before activation:

1. Load codex into repo
2. Assign Domain Governors
3. Register Prime agent
4. Register Supervisor
5. Validate worker contracts
6. Configure Relay boundaries
7. Initialize audit logging
8. Run dry-run simulation under STOP–RESET–REALIGN conditions

---

## **3. PR Deliverable**

This document **is** the PR payload.
No additions required.

---

## **4. Change Control**

All modifications must:

* be approved at Prime + Human level
* follow Charter governance
* maintain domain boundaries
* include version bump (v2, v3, …)

---

## **5. Ready for Activation**

This codex is complete, scoped correctly, Charter-aligned, MAOS-implementable, drift-resistant, and ready for real-world deployment.

**Charter: EXECUTION**
**Charter: ALIGNMENT**
**Charter: ON**
